Important: Before running the scripts, make sure to modify the file paths in each R script so they match the location on your computer. Otherwise, the code will not run properly.

Step 1. Data Cleaning
Start by running the Data Cleaning R script. This script prepares the dataset for analysis.

Step 2. EA_SVAR
Continue with the EA_SVAR R script. This estimates the structural sign restricted VAR for the euro area.

Step 3. Country-specific Scripts
Run the country-level R scripts individually. These scripts are named after each country, such as: Austria.R, Belgium.R etc.

Step 4. Regression
Finally, run the Regression R script. This script uses the outputs from previous steps for the final analysis.
